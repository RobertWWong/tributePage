                        In the early 60's, we had a few industrial robots, and some professors sought to form a learned society, to be called Robotology. I was aghast. The appellation for our discipline had been coined by Asimov in the 40's: Robotics. I am happy to say Asimov prevailed.

                       There was a generation of scientists who are now between 40 and 60 who were tremendously influenced by his writing. It had adventure and it had science even though he sometimes did not understand what he was writing about. In a technical or scientific sense, it was well written and it had a sense of optimism. Intrinsic to his writing was the notion that there isn't anything that we can't master. His world view was that we can solve all the problems of the world.

                         Isaac Asimov always encouraged his readers to try to see the world as comprehensible, to despise superstition and moral cowardice, and to think and speak clearly and simply. He was not falsely modest, but was always honest, unpretentious and humorous. To me he was among the finest of modern philosophers.

                        When Isaac Asimov passed away, the world lost an unbridled dreamer and at the same time a sober scientist and analyst. Asimov merged a formidable literary talent with a deep understanding of science and its meaning. He did this not only in terms of technological progress, but also in terms of the development of our own personalities, penetrating a sometimes puzzling and horrifying world of contemporary science.

                        The wonder of his generous -- torrential -- response to the public's increasingly anxious interest in science was his clarity and integrity. He leveled with his readers, never condescended and never overheated the story.
